## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/dellis67/dellis67.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

# Trying to write in Markdown
## Feels somehow foreign but also vaguely familiar, kind of like the very early days of wordprocessing where one used in-line commands for formatting.
Wordstar anyone?
Getting the syntax into your hands and out of your head was the key, as I'm sure it is here too.

Now how do links work? [Like This?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx#/media/File:Lynx_lynx_poing.jpg) I guess so. Weird

Images too, I suppose have some syntactical uniqueness.

Just like URL links. How about photos on my computer? Not obvious.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/dellis67/dellis67.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
